# UltimateKakasScript
### This is a part of an inside joke
The bat downloads a png on the local user's acount then makes it the backgroung.
It also inststals a script, that starts with the computer so it changes int back, in case the user changed it.

Anyway here is a [download](https://github.com/Sandormate0513/UltimateKakasScript/raw/refs/heads/main/kakas.bat) link and here is an [uninstaller](https://github.com/Sandormate0513/UltimateKakasScript/blob/main/kakas_uninstall.bat) for it.

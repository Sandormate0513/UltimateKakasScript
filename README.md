### This is a part of an inside joke
The bat downloads a png on the local user's acount then makes it the backgroung.
It also inststals a script, that starts with the computer so it changes int back, in case the user changed it.

Anyway here is a <a href="https://github.com/Sandormate0513/UltimateKakasScript/raw/refs/tags/First/kakas.bat" download>download</a> link and here is an <a href="https://github.com/Sandormate0513/UltimateKakasScript/raw/refs/tags/First/kakas_uninstall.bat" download>uninstaller</a> for it.
